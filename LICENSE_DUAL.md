# License Information

MeshAG is dual-licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3)** and a **Commercial License**.

## 1. Open Source License (AGPLv3)

The "Community Edition" of MeshAG is licensed under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3)](./LICENSE).

**You are free to:**
- Use the software for personal or internal business purposes.
- Modify the source code.
- Distribute the software, provided you adhere to the AGPLv3 terms.

**Obligations under AGPLv3:**
- If you modify the software and distribute it (or run it as a network service/SaaS), you **must** make your source code available to users under the same AGPLv3 license.
- You must include the original copyright notice and license.

## 2. Commercial License (Enterprise)

A **Commercial License** is required for organizations that wish to:
- Use MeshAG in a commercial product where the source code is kept proprietary (closed-source).
- Offer MeshAG as a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) without releasing their modifications or wrapper code.
- Receive enterprise support and assurances.

If your use case requires these freedoms (e.g., "selling it as a SaaS" without open-sourcing your changes), you must obtain a commercial license.
